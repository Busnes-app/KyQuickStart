# Contributing to KyQuickStart

KyQuickStart is the deterministic command-line installer that stands up the Ky suite and selected third-party apps across operator-provided Docker and Kubernetes hosts. Contributions must preserve validated operations, ownership checks, safe credential handling, and verifiable results. Expansion is frozen; see docs/redirect.md.

## Before contributing

Read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md),
the [README](README.md), and any AGENTS.md in the subtree you are about to
touch. Open an issue before proposing a feature larger than a bug fix or
documentation change.

Keep changes small, reuse existing code, and fix the shared root cause rather
than the reported symptom. New non-trivial logic ships with a runnable test or
self-check.

## Security requirements

- Validate and narrow every input at the boundary (CLI args, config, SSH targets) before acting on it.
- Handle SSH keys, tokens, and generated secrets safely; never log them; write secret files with least privilege.
- Fail closed on missing or inconsistent configuration with a readable error and a remediation step.
- No new catalog apps or standalone orchestration features — only compatibility, safety, verification, and the AI integration.
- Do not add telemetry, phone-home, analytics, or unconfigured third-party
  services.
- Do not add silent security fallbacks; fail closed with a readable error and a
  remediation step.
- Name and document any security trade-off in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before
  it merges.

## Verification

Run the checks that apply to the files you changed, and the repository's
full required checks before hand-off. Record the exact commands and their
results in the pull request.

## AI attribution

AI-assisted contributions are welcome; undisclosed ones are not. Disclose
material AI assistance in the pull request — the tool, what it changed, and what
you personally ran, read, and verified — and add a commit trailer naming any
tool that materially contributed. You are the author of the code you submit for
every purpose, regardless of how it was produced.

## Pull requests

Branch off `main` with a focused name, and use a Conventional Commit subject
(`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, or `chore:`). The pull request
explains why the change exists, the verification performed, the security impact,
and any known limitations.

Every pull request gets an adversarial review pass; see
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#hostile-reviews-are-about-code-never-people)
for what that is and the boundary it keeps.
